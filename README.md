### Project Overview

This project moves beyond theoretical concepts to mathematically construct the mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium from the ground up. The core objective was to quantify the strategic necessity of bluffing and to determine the optimal frequencies for each player's actions under uncertainty.

### Key Concepts and Techniques Applied:

* **Game Theory:** Modeled the game tree, payoff matrix, and strategic interactions.
* **Nash Equilibrium:** Derived the optimal, stable strategies for both players.
* **Bayesian Inference:** Used to update player beliefs based on observed actions.
* **Indifference Principle:** Applied to calculate the precise bluffing and calling frequencies.
* **Expected Value (EV) Analysis:** Performed detailed EV calculations for every possible game state to validate the optimal strategy.
